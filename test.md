# Comprehensive Literature Review

| Title | Short Summary | Potential Student Activity | Super Cool Example |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 1. The Critical Role of Literature Reviews | Introduction to the importance of literature reviews in neuroscience. | **Activity:** Have students quickly jot down what they think the purpose of a literature review is. Then, using an interactive online tool (like Kahoot!), let students share their definitions and vote on which they think is the most accurate. | **Example:** The story of the discovery of the neuron's action potential. If Hodgkin and Huxley hadn't thoroughly reviewed the existing literature, they might not have won the Nobel Prize. |
| 2.
