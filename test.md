Certainly! Here's a proposed course outline for the 3-hour course on "Keeping Proper Logs/ Notebooks" tailored for PhD students in neuroscience:

### Table 1: 3-hour Course Outline

| Title | Short Summary | Potential Student Activity | Super Cool Example |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| 1. The Importance of Proper Logging | Discussing the significance of meticulous record-keeping in neuroscience research. | Students brainstorm the worst possible outcomes of poor logging in a research project. | The story of Andrew Wakefield, who lost his medical license due to improper research documentation and unethical behavior in his study linking vaccines to autism. |
| 2. The Art of Detail | Why every small detail matters in research logging. | Students are given a poorly logged experiment and have to identify errors and omissions. | The tragic case of Jesse Gelsinger, who died during a gene therapy trial due to overlooked details and lapses in documentation. |
| 3. Chronological Logging | The importance of keeping records in sequence. | Students shuffle experiment steps and then re-order them based on logical sequence and importance. | The discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick, highlighting how their chronological notes were crucial in understanding the structure. |
| 4. Replicability and Transparency | Ensuring experiments can be reproduced and understood by peers. | Students swap notebooks and attempt to replicate a simple experiment based on another student’s notes. | The retraction of high-profile papers due to lack of replicability, such as those in the field of social priming. |
| 5. Digital vs. Manual | Pros and cons of digital logging tools vs. traditional notebooks. | Students compare notes from a digital tool and a handwritten notebook, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. | The case of a major data loss at a research institution due to over-reliance on digital tools without proper backups. |
| 6. Protecting Data Integrity | Discussing how to ensure data remains unaltered and genuine. | Students are presented with tampered data and must identify inconsistencies. | The story of Hwang Woo-suk, who falsified his stem cell research data, leading to his fall from grace. |
| 7. Ethical Considerations | Exploring the moral implications of proper logging. | Students debate on hypothetical situations where logging can have ethical implications. | The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which lacked proper informed consent and documentation, leading to unethical treatment of participants. |
| 8. Empowerment Through Proper Logging | Ending on a positive note, discussing how proper logging can elevate one’s research. | Students share their personal experiences where proper logging saved them from potential pitfalls. | The story of Rosalind Franklin, whose meticulous notes and research paved the way for many scientific breakthroughs, even if she didn’t receive immediate recognition. |

### Table 2: 45-minute Short Course Outline

| Title | Short Summary | Potential Student Activity | Super Cool Example |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| 1. The Art of Detail | Emphasizing the significance of minute details in research logging. | Students identify errors in a brief poorly logged experiment. | The story of Jesse Gelsinger and the tragic outcome of a gene therapy trial. |
| 2. Replicability and Transparency | Highlighting the essence of clarity and replicability in research notes. | Students try to replicate a simple experiment based on a peer's notes. | Instances of high-profile retractions due to lack of replicability, like in the field of social priming. |
| 3. Empowerment Through Proper Logging | Discussing the positive impact of meticulous logging on research quality. | Students share a time when proper logging benefitted their own work. | Rosalind Franklin’s detailed research notes that greatly impacted the field of molecular biology. |

I hope this provides a comprehensive structure for your course. Adjustments can be made based on specific student feedback or any other considerations.
